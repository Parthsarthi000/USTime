# USTime

USTime is a design concept for a productivity and habit-forming app designed to help UST students—especially Year 1s—build discipline, manage time effectively, and navigate university life with confidence.

## Purpose

Planning your day shouldn't feel like a second job. UST Scheduler streamlines your daily and weekly scheduling, integrates your class timetable, to-do lists, and study goals, and helps you stay on top of everything—from assignments to exam prep.

## Key Concepts

- **Timetable + To-Do Integration**  
  Input your class schedule and daily tasks. The app generates a personalized daily plan that fits your academic and personal goals.

- **Weekly Task Optimization**  
  Add tasks for the entire week and let the app create a smart, balanced schedule that adapts to your availability.

- **Gamified Habit Formation**  
  Build discipline through fun challenges, memes, and motivational nudges that make productivity feel rewarding.

- **AI-Powered Exam Prep**  
  Tell the app how difficult a course feels and how much time you need. It generates a stress-reducing study schedule tailored to your needs.

## Why It Matters

Students often waste valuable time just organizing their day. UST Scheduler eliminates that friction, giving you clarity, structure, and motivation—all in one place.
